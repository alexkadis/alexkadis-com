What&#8217;s the best way to create jobs?

Startups! &#8230; according to a [Kauffman Foundation][1] study. That study is now the basis for the Federal Government&#8217;s new effort called [Startup America Partnership][2] to encourage job growth by scaling startups.

Today at [Shaker LaunchHouse][3], Alex Gold spoke to a packed house about Startup America Partnership, and how LaunchHouse members can benefit from the resources available.

For those who don&#8217;t know about LaunchHouse it&#8217;s basically [the most badass thing to come to Cleveland][4] in a long time:

> LaunchHouse is a lean new public-private partnership that fosters entrepreneurial success and job creation through seed capital, education and innovation. This Northeast Ohio organization connects new entrepreneurs with proven business leaders in a grassroots, for-profit model that can be successfully replicated nationwide. 

Let&#8217;s spice up that corporate-speak:

> What happens when you gut a car-dealership, and throw in a ton of funky office equipment? You get LaunchHouse &#8212; an extraordinary place for entrepreneurs to meet, collaborate, learn from one-another, and raise capital. A dynamic and somewhat crazy environment where you feel creative just by walking through the door. It houses everything from the makers of [tasty healthy snack bars][5] to [medical innovators][6] to a network for [sharing class notes][7] and [everything in between][8]. 

And it&#8217;s for those reasons exactly that as of this morning I am officially a member of the LaunchHouse community. I can think of no better place in Cleveland to do my job search &#8212; surrounded by people doing awesomely interesting stuff.

Anyway&#8230; back to Startup America Partnership.

The government&#8217;s [new effort][2] was launched only yesterday and LaunchHouse members have all been pre-approved. It&#8217;s a way to connect startups to nearly $10 billion dollars in resources ranging from [50% off all Google Adwords][9] to [$200 million dollars in investment by Intel][10] and [Facebook training done by Facebook itself][11].

They&#8217;ll offer some sort of mentorship (how that&#8217;ll work is still being figured out), and they&#8217;re soliciting ideas of how to do the Ohio branch. Startup Ohio will reflect the needs here at home. Since it&#8217;s still in the planning stages there&#8217;s a lot of room for Ohio entrepreneurs to get involved.

The goal is to scale some startups like [LivingSocial][12] which has [grown significantly][13] since it was founded. Gold said that the result will be threefold: *&#8220;jobs, jobs and more jobs&#8221;*.
