On Wednesday, 24 August 2011, I along with 50 others attended [Dave Weinberg][1]&#8216;s [Future of Jewish Nonprofit summit][2] (FOJNP) in New York. The event brought together some great minds in the nonprofit Jewish world to talk about how to [raise money][3] in these difficult times, proper use of social media ([Google+][4], [Facebook][5], [Twitter][6] and [LinkedIn][7]), and how to [get your ideas out there][8]. I think it was a resounding success.

I heard about the FOJNP from William Daroff, the ever [tweeting][11] and very important (have you seen the people he meets with?) Jewish super-professional. Daroff was one of the speakers, and talked about the importance of Twitter in any media strategy. He presented with [Rabbi Steven Burg][12] of [NCSY][13]. I was very impressed in the way Dave put the speakers together; in such a way that topics flowed easily from one to the next. Rabbi Burg is a self-admitted social-media novice compared to Daroff (but really, who isn&#8217;t?), and spoke of the need to use Facebook for proper interaction with his target audience: 15 year olds. He went on to say that, &#8220;tech does **not** replace human contact&#8221;. And he&#8217;s right. We need to use tech to find people, but it&#8217;s personal interaction that moves people forward. The importance of not relying on technology was poignant during the summit, as a wifi outage led to some amusing and somewhat desperate sounding Tweets:



The Future of Jewish Nonprofit summit was a wonderful kick-off for my job search &#8212; a mysterious and nebulous art with thousands of books on the subject and no right answer of how to do it. (There are [23,605 books according to Amazon][14], two of which I&#8217;m reading now.) Everything that I&#8217;ve read agrees on one thing, that you need to reach out and speak to as many people as possible. For that, I am thankful to Dave for the FOJNP summit. It gave me a chance to practice my networking skills, and to get advice from people who are important members of the Jewish nonprofit world.

Here&#8217;s some things I took away from FOJNP:

  * [Ventureneer][15]&#8216;s [Geri Stengel][16] talking on a panel with [Saul Orbach][17] (TMT Strategic Advisors) and [Avi Zollman][18] ([Jewish Funders Network][19]) talking about the challenges of raising funding in today&#8217;s economy. The important take away: make sure you&#8217;re evaluating what you do, and publishing those evaluations as a story anyone can understand. People of my generation want to know where their money is going.
  * [Big Duck][20]&#8216;s [Farra Trompeter][21] talked about about Google+. It&#8217;s really fun to think about the constantly changing social networking landscape &#8212; and how we can best take advantage of the changes.
  * LinkedIn professionals gave some tips [on how nonprofits can best use the network][22]. Basically, spend some time getting to know [http://learn.linkedin.com/nonprofits]() and follow their advice in the help documents. (Since I&#8217;m looking for a job, I&#8217;m going to be spending a lot of time looking at [the job seeker section][23]) of their site.
  * Hadassah Levy of [Jewish Ideas Daily][8] made me realize that I need to update my blog more, and that I should try and get more involved in the organizations I care about.
