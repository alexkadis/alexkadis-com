I've been trying to figure out good side projects. Here's what I have in mind:

## Gitting my site up to date (done).
1. Migrated my website from A Small Orange to Linode. I might go into my reasoning in another post.
2. Reread the first few chapters of [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), which is required by Tech Elevator before I start on Monday. 
2. Pushed my local version of the site to GitHub for the first time in a while.
3. My "migration" was a simple drag-and-drop of the files, I wanted it to actually, ya know, work... so after quite a bit of trial and error, I set up Jekyll on my new server.
4. I added an alias in my `.bashrc` to pull from GitHub and build with Jekyll:

```bash
alias gitjekyll="git pull origin master && jekyll build"
```

## Learn algorithms
I struggled in school with learning how algorithms work because algebra and calculus have *never* come easy to me. 

So, in addition to Tech Elevator, I'm going to do some Kahn Academy courses: 

- [Algorithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms)
- [Algebra II, Exponentials &amp; logarithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/exponential-and-logarithmic-functions) 
- [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)

Then try to apply that knowledge with few different resources:

- [Algorithms and data structures implemented in JavaScript with explanations and links to further readings](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms)
- [Everything you need to know to get the job](https://github.com/kdn251/interviews)
- [Videos of technical mock interviews](https://interviewing.io/recordings)
- [100 Days of Algorithms](https://github.com/coells/100days) and the [accompanying blog post](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms/100-days-of-algorithms-challenge-41996f7e1ec8) ([all posts ranked oldest to newest](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms/latest))

### The questions I'm starting with:

- How do you determine the *correct* algorithm to use?
- How do you know if an algorithm is inefficient and should be replaced?
- How do you identify an algorithm that you've already seen?
- What the heck is big-O notation?

### Documenting my work
While I'll never be a math-whiz, maybe I can better understand logarithms and linear algebra. Although I've [been told](https://twitter.com/vboykis/status/981542924080107521) that "If you do database stuff, you're already inherently dealing with linear algebra and matrix operations" -- maybe it's just a matter of understanding what I already know!

Throughout the process, I'll try to document my progress here, sharing what I'm learning. I learn best by teaching others, so maybe it'll help.
