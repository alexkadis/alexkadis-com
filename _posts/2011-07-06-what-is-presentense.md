So I figured if I&#8217;m going to be talking about what I&#8217;m doing in Israel, I might as well start with the present (yup, that&#8217;s a pun) &#8212; and work backwards. I assume I&#8217;ll work backwards, I suppose we&#8217;ll see tomorrow.

So here&#8217;s a crash course in PresenTense &#8212; what they do, why I&#8217;m volunteering with them, etc.

In short, PresenTense (PT) helps innovative Jews create social start-ups, so they can in-turn change their communities for the better.

<!--more-->

I say Jews, because that&#8217;s the main focus, but really the community is open to anyone with a good idea (and maybe a plan) of how to improve the world around them. Even then, PT invests it&#8217;s time and energy in people, not exact ideas. PresenTense started off as a [magazine][1].

After a little while, they discovered that the innovative social entrepreneurs that they were writing about needed advice and direction &#8212; so they started the summer [Global Institute][2] (GI). The Global Institute Fellowship is in its 5th year, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working on now.

PT has also expanded into [local fellowships][3] in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Boston, New York and Philadelphia. PT calls them Community Entrepreneur Partnerships or CEP.

In case you haven&#8217;t noticed, PresenTense absolutely loves buzzwords and terminology. Like to the point where I&#8217;m pretty sure we have a dictionary of phrases that we use lying around somewhere; if we don&#8217;t, we need one.

**Coming up next/soonish:** I started out my time with PresenTense as I was finishing with OTZMA. It was just as we were getting ready for Launch Nights &#8211; which I think I&#8217;ll write about in a different blog post.

These days I spend a lot of time running the [PresenTense blog][4], and working on making PT&#8217;s web presence sustainable for the future. I&#8217;ll also talk more about the Fellows, and the various tech we use behind PresenTense to make it go.

Maybe someone out there on the [lazy web][5] will have ideas of how we can improve the stuff we use.
