[In this post Felicia Day talks about Gamer Gate, her fears, and her love of gaming][1] and it is one of the more powerful and personal pieces I&#8217;ve read on the entire subject. Well worth the read. 

FYI not long after she posted this she was doxxed. (Personal info often including location was shared publicly).

I consider her a geek idol and it&#8217;s terrible to see her, and others scared to be who they are online and in person. Wishing for this harassment to stop isn&#8217;t enough, we need to fundamentally change geek culture so that attacks like these are unacceptable and don&#8217;t happen to begin with. That means guys like myself can&#8217;t stand on the sidelines anymore either. It means supporting women in tech during not only the bad times like now, but when things seem ok; when subtle (or not so subtle) sexism is holding women back from being able to pursue their passions. 

I realize I have a lot to learn about the subject, and I hope you&#8217;ll learn with me.
