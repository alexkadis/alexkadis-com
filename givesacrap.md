I have a few charities and causes that receive my time and money. With everything going on in the United States, and around the world, philanthropy has become ever more important to me. I&rsquo;m sharing this in the hope that maybe I can convince you to give too.


### [ORT America](https://www.ortamerica.org/regions/ohio-region/next-gen-ohio/)

I&rsquo;m the Next Gen Chair of ORT America&rsquo;s Ohio Region, helping to fundraise for one of the largest non-governmental education organizations in the world. ORT has programs in 37 countries and teaches over 300,000 students every year; giving them the skills they need to succeed in their communities.

### [Jewish Big Brothers and Big Sisters](http://www.bellefairejcb.org/programs-and-services/mentoring/)

I have been a *Big* since December 2017 and mentoring him is *so* rewarding. My *Little* has the same interests as me: LEGO, video games, and history. I kinda think that says more about me than him.


### [Emily&rsquo;s List](https://www.emilyslist.org/)

Helping to elect progressive women to public office. More important now than ever before. I just increased my monthly donation.


### [Senator Sherrod Brown&rsquo;s Reelection Campaign](https://www.sherrodbrown.com/)

I really, *really* want Sherrod to win.


### [Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-greater-ohio)

Reproductive healthcare for women is important to me, and I&rsquo;m terrified that Roe v Wade could be reversed.


### [Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)](https://www.splcenter.org/)

They&rsquo;ve been fighting against hate groups and for civil rights since 1971. I&rsquo;m so angry how important they are right now.


### [Jewish Federation of Cleveland](http://www.jewishcleveland.org/)

They&rsquo;re the backbone of the Jewish community in Cleveland, providing everything from education to healthcare.


### [JCC Krakow](http://www.friendsofjcckrakow.org/)
Growing and strengthening a Jewish community a mere 60 miles from Auschwitz.

It doesn&rsquo;t matter how you give back, just do *something*.
