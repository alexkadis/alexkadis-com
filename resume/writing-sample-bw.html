			<p>There is no shortage of great organizations to contribute time and effort to, so how do you choose just one? </p>

			<p>Lehigh has nearly 150 clubs on campus, from the Anime Eki club to the Hawaiian Culture Appreciation club. Regardless of your interests-be them sports, entertainment or culture, you can definitely find a club that suits you.</p>

			<p>The first week of classes is not only memorable because it&#8217;s the first of many to come, but also because it contains the event that glorifies all of our student-run activities, the club fair. </p>

			<p>It was a resounding success this year. And last year. And the year before that. Many students picked up information, grabbed free food and swag and signed themselves up on e-mail lists. Yet, it is easy to sign up for clubs and then quickly forget all about them. </p>

			<p>If this is your first year, you&#8217;ve probably spent most of your time exploring frat parties or finding a new favorite corner of Linderman. Despite the demands on your schedule, make the effort to find time for extracurriculars.</p>

			<p>Do yourself that favor by attending the first couple of club meetings that interest you and once you find something you like, try to push yourself to help out. If nothing else, you could get some free food out of the deal.</p>

			<p>Now, here&#8217;s a challenge: I encourage you not only to get involved but also to turn your sights toward social activism on campus. You do not have to be a hippie to join Green Action, nor do you have to live in a foreign country to join the Association of International Students. </p>

			<p>Knowledge of a topic is rarely necessary to join a club that focuses on activism; all you need is less time spent on your computer or napping and a willingness to learn. You may be surprised to find out that your ideas will have a considerable impact on the people around you. Every club requires new students each year in order to survive. Without clubs pushing for social change, critical issues can fade from the campus&#8217; public consciousness. </p>

			<p>College is the perfect time to learn how to be philanthropic. For many people being philanthropic means being financially generous, so it has earned a bad reputation. Being philanthropic actually entails being generous with your time by committing to something in which you believe. You may think that you don&#8217;t want to spread yourself thin now, but once you graduate, it is likely that you will have even fewer hours available, even if you do have the salary to continue your charitable actions.</p>

			<p>If you have never done community service, it&#8217;s okay. That doesn&#8217;t make you a bad person. However, you are missing out. Community service is rewarding and a lot of fun, and it&#8217;s a chance to meet people who share the same passions as you do. If a club does not exist for the issue you care about most, round up some of your friends and create it here on campus. It&#8217;s easier than you think. </p>

			<p>Even if you&#8217;re an upperclassman, there is no reason you can&#8217;t devote some of your time and effort toward a social issue you care about, especially when there are so many injustices that we can inform our community about while furthering our own education. There are wars and famine in distant and nearby countries of which few are aware. Your voice can make a difference. </p>

			<p>Volunteer with the Microfinance Club and help look for solutions to global poverty. Join Amnesty International and fight for human rights. Tackle sustainability and development with Engineers Without Borders.</p>

			<p>If you are looking to solve problems closer to home, opportunities abound. You could become a mentor to a young man or woman with Big Brothers Big Sisters. Educate the students on campus about abusive relationships by getting involved with the Women&#8217;s Center. Save lives with Lehigh University Emergency Medical Services. Discuss the issues of the day with World Affairs, College Democrats or College Republicans. You can even tutor peers. </p>

			<p>If the charity itself is not enough to entice you, think about this: volunteering can greatly boost your resume. One of the benefits of studying at a small university is if you want to help run an organization, you can do so right here on campus. Unlike other volunteer organizations you encounter elsewhere, you can become vital to a club very quickly at Lehigh. </p>

			<p>Do yourself a favor. Give time to a cause you care about!</p>
