  <article class="post-content">
  <p>I have cultivated a reputation for having an &ldquo;unusually strong ability to understand computing needs from the viewpoint of a program participant or staff member, and to envision and implement appropriate and easily managed solutions,&ldquo; possessing an obsessive level of organization, and for being, &ldquo;notably personable for a geek.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In my free time and when I can make it happen at work, I take computers and software apart to see how they tick, write, edit, mentor and teach my colleagues and friends, launch ventures, organize nouns (people, places, things, ideas), administer databases, and ski. I have yet to figure out how to make skiing part of work, but I&rsquo;m dreaming about it.</p>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re interested, I am open to opportunities in Cleveland. Check out my portfolio and resume for details.</p>
